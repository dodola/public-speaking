# Caveats with eBPF
/!
### Kernel
/!
// Probe is compiled against the kernel
// See demo for concrete example with clang9 vs clang10
// It's a rare low level new utility
/!
### Dynamically loaded from userspace
/!
// BPF program (probe.c) is compiled to ELF object
// Dynamically loaded as a driver at runtime
// No more device drivers
/!
