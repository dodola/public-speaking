// Alas, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent
// and admirable hobbits. I don't know half of you half as well as I should like,
// and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
/!
// I have things to do.

// I regret to announce â€” this is The End. I am going now.
// I bid you all a very fond farewell.
